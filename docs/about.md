# Foslog

**Foslog** is a web app to write and read reviews for **films, series, video games, books, and music** all in one place.

---

## Motivation

Unlike apps like _Letterboxd_ or _Goodreads_ that are limited to just one kind of media — films, series, video games, books, or music. **Foslog** breaks that barrier by bringing them all together in a single place. Our goal is to make it easier to share your thoughts and explore recommendations across different forms of entertainment, without needing to juggle multiple apps.

## Benefits

- Discover **new hobbies and works** thanks to the variety of reviews gathered in one platform.
- Expand your interests by connecting recommendations across different media types.

## Technology

- Built with **Next.js** as the main framework.
- **React 19** – Core library for the user interface.
- **TailwindCSS 4** – Utility-first CSS framework.
- **NextAuth** – Authentication and session management.
- **Zustand** – Lightweight global state management.
- **Next-Intl** – Internationalization and translations.
- **Vitest** – Unit testing.
- **Testing Library** – React component testing.
