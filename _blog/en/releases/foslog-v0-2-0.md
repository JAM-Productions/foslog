# Welcome to Foslog v0.2.0

We are thrilled to announce the release of **Foslog v0.2.0**, a major update that lays the foundation for a more robust and user-friendly platform. This version introduces significant improvements in user experience, internationalization, and authentication.

## What's New

### Enhanced User Experience
- **Cohesive Cream Palette**: A new light theme with a cohesive cream palette for a more pleasant viewing experience.
- **Improved Mobile Experience**: We've fixed the mobile browser zoom on input focus by using a 16px font size, making the interface more user-friendly on mobile devices.
- **Dynamic Year**: The "fromDateOnwards" feature now uses a dynamic year, ensuring the information is always up-to-date.

### Internationalization
- **Language Selector**: You can now switch between English, Spanish, and Catalan.
- **Language Preference**: Your language preference is saved in local storage for a seamless experience.
- **Missing Translations**: We've added missing translations to provide a more consistent multilingual experience.

### Authentication and Security
- **Login and Signup**: We've implemented the login and signup functionality, allowing you to create an account and access personalized features.
- **Better Auth Integration**: We've integrated Better Auth for a more secure and reliable authentication system.
- **Verification Table**: A new verification table has been added to the Prisma schema for Better Auth.

### Under the Hood
- **Component Abstraction**: We've abstracted components and added missing tests to improve code quality and maintainability.
- **CI/CD Improvements**: We've added a Vitest job to our CI pipeline to ensure the quality of our code.
- **Dependency Updates**: We've updated our dependencies to the latest versions to keep the platform secure and performant.
