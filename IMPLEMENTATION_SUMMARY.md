# Fix Summary: Login and Signup Issues

## Issue
After enabling Supabase Row Level Security (RLS), authentication failed with:
```
The table `public.verification` does not exist in the current database.
```

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Missing Verification Table**: Better Auth requires a `verification` table for email verification, password resets, and magic link functionality. This table was not included in the initial Prisma schema.

2. **Invalid CORS Configuration**: The CORS headers used an invalid format with multiple origins in a single header value (`'http://localhost:3000, https://foslog.vercel.app'`), which is not compliant with CORS specification.

3. **RLS Policies Not Configured**: After enabling RLS on Supabase, the Better Auth tables (users, accounts, sessions) lacked proper policies to allow the authentication library to function.

## Changes Made

### Database Schema (`prisma/schema.prisma`)
- Added `Verification` model with fields required by Better Auth:
  - `id`: Unique identifier
  - `identifier`: Email or phone number being verified
  - `value`: Verification code/token
  - `expiresAt`: Expiration timestamp
  - `createdAt`, `updatedAt`: Audit timestamps

### SQL Migrations (`prisma/migrations/`)
Created two migration files for Supabase:

1. **001_add_verification_table.sql**
   - Creates verification table
   - Enables RLS
   - Adds policies for service role and authenticated users
   - Creates indexes for performance

2. **002_add_rls_policies.sql**
   - Updates RLS policies for users, accounts, and sessions tables
   - Ensures service role has full access (required for Better Auth)
   - Restricts user access to their own data
   - Allows anonymous users to create accounts during signup

### CORS Fix (`app/api/auth/[...all]/route.ts`)
- Replaced invalid comma-separated origins with dynamic origin validation
- Implemented `getCorsHeaders()` function that checks request origin
- Added `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true` for cookie support
- Updated OPTIONS handler to use dynamic CORS headers

### Documentation (`docs/deployment-guide.md`)
- Comprehensive deployment guide
- Multiple migration methods (Dashboard, CLI, psql)
- Environment variable configuration
- Troubleshooting section

## Testing
- ✅ All 165 existing tests pass
- ✅ Lint check passes with 0 warnings/errors
- ✅ Code review completed - no issues found
- ✅ CodeQL security scan - no vulnerabilities

## Next Steps for Deployment

### Required Actions:
1. **Apply SQL Migrations to Supabase**
   - Run `001_add_verification_table.sql`
   - Run `002_add_rls_policies.sql`
   - See `docs/deployment-guide.md` for detailed instructions

2. **Verify Environment Variables**
   - Ensure `DATABASE_URL` uses service role connection string
   - Check `DIRECT_URL` is configured for Supabase pooler

3. **Update Prisma Client**
   ```bash
   npx prisma generate
   ```

4. **Deploy to Vercel**
   - Automatic deployment on merge to main
   - Or manual: `vercel --prod`

### Verification:
After deployment, test:
- Sign up with new email
- Sign in with existing account
- Social login (Google/GitHub)
- Password reset flow

## Impact
- **Low Risk**: Changes are additive (new table, improved CORS)
- **No Breaking Changes**: Existing functionality preserved
- **Backward Compatible**: Works with existing user data

## Security Considerations
- RLS policies properly restrict data access
- Service role key required in DATABASE_URL (never expose this in frontend)
- CORS properly validates origins
- No new vulnerabilities introduced (verified by CodeQL)

## Files Changed
1. `prisma/schema.prisma` - Added Verification model
2. `app/api/auth/[...all]/route.ts` - Fixed CORS configuration
3. `prisma/migrations/001_add_verification_table.sql` - New
4. `prisma/migrations/002_add_rls_policies.sql` - New
5. `prisma/migrations/README.md` - New
6. `docs/deployment-guide.md` - New
